# LangGraph Agent System - Flow Analysis & Optimization

## Current System Flows

### Flow 1: Simple Question (No Planning)
```
User Input → Classification → Execution → Response
```
**Types**: `general`, `calculation`
**Example**: "What is 2+2?"

**Current Steps**:
1. User sends message via WebSocket
2. Classification (300ms delay)
3. Direct execution with ReACT loop
4. Stream response to user

**Issues**:
- ❌ Unnecessary 300ms delays even for simple queries
- ❌ ReACT system prompt added every time (overhead)
- ❌ 50ms delay per word in streaming (too slow for short answers)

---

### Flow 2: Complex Question with Planning
```
User Input → Classification → Planning → Auto-Execute → Response
```
**Types**: `research`, `code`, `creative`
**Example**: "Is it true that Lecornu lied on his resume?"

**Current Steps**:
1. User sends message
2. Classification (no delays ✅)
3. Plan creation (no delays ✅)
4. Plan displayed to user (for transparency)
5. Auto-approved execution
6. ReACT loop execution (up to 10 iterations)
7. Stream final answer (chunked, fast ✅)

**Improvements**:
- ✅ No artificial delays (was 600ms)
- ✅ Auto-approval for seamless flow (was manual confirmation)
- ✅ Progress indicators for all tools
- ✅ Tool results display 2000 chars (was 500)

---

### Flow 3: ReACT Tool Execution Loop
```
Loop:
  Model → Parse Response → Execute Tool → Add to History → Model
  Exit: Final Answer or Max Iterations (10)
```

**Current Steps per Iteration**:
1. Model invocation (~2-5s)
2. Parse ReACT format
3. Execute tool (web_search: ~3-5s, browser_navigate: ~5-10s)
4. Send truncated result to user
5. Add full observation to history
6. Next iteration

**Issues**:
- ❌ No parallel tool execution (sequential only)
- ❌ Truncating observations to 500 chars loses context
- ❌ No caching of search results
- ❌ Browser instance created/closed per navigation (slow)
- ❌ Word-by-word streaming (50ms delay) is slow
- ❌ No timeout on individual tools

## Detailed Flow Map

### WebSocket Message Flow
```typescript
ws.on("message")
  ├─ type: "chat"
  │   ├─ Classification
  │   ├─ Planning (if needed)
  │   └─ Execution
  │
  ├─ type: "confirm"
  │   └─ Execute with plan
  │
  └─ type: "clear"
      └─ Clear session
```

### Tool Execution Flow
```typescript
executeResponse()
  ├─ Add ReACT prompt (if new)
  ├─ ReACT Loop (max 10 iterations)
  │   ├─ Model.invoke()
  │   ├─ parseReACTResponse()
  │   ├─ IF Final Answer
  │   │   └─ Stream to user (word by word, 50ms delay)
  │   │
  │   └─ IF Action
  │       ├─ Notify user of tool call
  │       ├─ Execute tool
  │       ├─ Send result (truncated to 500 chars)
  │       └─ Add full observation to history
  │
  └─ Max iterations reached → Error
```

### Available Tools
1. **web_search** - Tavily API (~3-5s)
2. **browser_navigate** - Playwright navigate (~5-10s)
3. **browser_extract** - Playwright extract (~5-10s)
4. **calculator** - Instant
5. **get_datetime** - Instant
6. **take_note** / **get_note** / **list_notes** - Instant

## Performance Bottlenecks

### Critical Issues 🔴

1. **Artificial Delays** ✅ FIXED
   - ~~300ms after classification~~
   - ~~300ms after planning~~
   - ~~500ms after classification result~~
   - ~~50ms per word during streaming~~
   - **Status**: All removed, ~1100ms saved

2. **Browser Instance Management** ✅ FIXED
   - ~~New browser launched for EVERY browser_navigate call~~
   - ~~No connection pooling~~
   - **Status**: Singleton pattern + smart networkidle loading

3. **Sequential Tool Execution** ⏸️ DEFERRED
   - Can't search multiple sources in parallel
   - Can't navigate multiple URLs simultaneously
   - **Status**: Requires ReACT model to request multiple tools (rare in practice)

4. **Observation Truncation** ✅ IMPROVED
   - ~~Tool results cut to 500 chars for user display~~
   - **Status**: Increased to 2000 chars (4x improvement)

### Medium Issues 🟡

5. **No Caching** ✅ FIXED
   - ~~Same search query executed multiple times~~
   - ~~No memoization of tool results~~
   - **Status**: LRU cache (5min TTL, 100 entries, instant repeat queries)

6. **No Timeouts** ✅ FIXED
   - ~~Individual tools can hang indefinitely~~
   - **Status**: 30s timeout on all tool executions with Promise.race

7. **Inefficient Streaming** ✅ FIXED
   - ~~Word-by-word with 50ms delay is slow~~
   - **Status**: 10-word chunks with 20ms delay (60% faster)

### Minor Issues 🟢

8. **ReACT Prompt Overhead** ✅ ACCEPTABLE
   - Large system prompt added to every conversation
   - **Status**: Necessary for ReACT pattern, token usage acceptable

9. **No Progress Indicators** ✅ FIXED
   - ~~User doesn't know what's happening during long tool calls~~
   - **Status**: Tool-specific detailed messages (e.g., "Searching the web for: X")

## Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Remove artificial delays (300ms classification, 500ms post-classification, 300ms planning, 300ms thinking)
- ✅ Increase tool result display from 500 to 2000 chars
- ✅ Add timeouts to all tools (30s max with Promise.race)
- ✅ Stream chunks instead of words (10 words with 20ms delay vs 1 word with 50ms delay)

### Phase 2: Browser Optimization ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Reuse browser instances (getBrowser() singleton already implemented)
- ✅ Replace fixed 2000ms waits with smart waitForLoadState("networkidle")
- ✅ Proper cleanup on errors (finally blocks)

### Phase 3: Caching & Intelligence ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ LRU cache for search results (5 minute TTL, 100 entry max)
- ✅ Better progress indicators (detailed messages for each tool)
- ⏸️ Smarter truncation (current: simple char limit)

### Phase 4: Parallel Execution (Future Enhancement)
- ⏸️ Detect when model requests multiple tools
- ⏸️ Execute in parallel with Promise.all()
- ⏸️ Combine results
